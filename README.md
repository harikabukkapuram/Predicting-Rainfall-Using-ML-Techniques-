# Predicting-Rainfall-Using-ML-Techniques-
A system to predict rainfall with 85% accuracy using historical weather data. Implemented Random Forest, Decision Tree, and SVM to analyze parameters such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure on a dataset of 50,000+ records. The model helps in better planning for agriculture, water resource management, and disaster preparedness.
